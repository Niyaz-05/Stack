# Stack
This Java program demonstrates a Stack data structure, which is a linear data structure following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top of the stack, similar to a pile of plates where only the top plate can be accessed at any time.
